# CTMP Proxy

My solution to the CoreTech Wirestorm challenge. The solution and tests for part 1 of the challenge can be found in branch 'part_1'.

## Building and Verifying
1. Clone the repository
2. Open a terminal window
3. ```cd``` into the repository
4. Compile the server code: ```gcc -o server server.c```
5. Run the server: ```./server```
6. In a separate terminal window, run the tests: ```python3 tests.py```
7. If all the tests pass, a success message will be shown
